# News-prediction
this news detection model was made using Logistic Regression.

I got the data from kaggle, though the data is old any may not be relevant to check news from nowadays.
this model shows the working of logistic regression to classify news into fake and real if real time data is being given to it

I trained the data(splitted it into train and test size of 0.75 and 0.25 respectively)

I made a function -Cleantext() to make the data simple so as to vectorize it in the next step
later i used pickle to get a .pkl file for vectorizer and logistic regression model.
